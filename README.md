Coding for him/her as a special gift.

# Kado
-Flower code from: https://codepen.io/mdusmanansari/pen/BamepLe


# How To Use The Files
After downloading the .zip file, visit www.replit.com. Create a new Repl under "HTML/CSS/JS". Upload all the files from the .zip folder into the Repl you just created. Then everything should work, if it doesn't work just send me a DM on my Tiktok :) Happy codding!

# index.html
To edit the name of the person, you can visit index.html
I have already created a 5 letter word "hello" if the person name is longer than 5 letters, you will have to do extra work so I suggest just do 5 and below. (line 14 - line 18)

# Card.html
To change background music, just replace "Bg.mp3" file.

To change card cover, just replace "Cover.Png". 
(Currently i'm using a resolution of 1,979px x 2,639px.)

Hopes this helps!           -xd3f4lt
